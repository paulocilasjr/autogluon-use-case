Setting dynamic_stacking from 'auto' to True. Reason: Enable dynamic_stacking when use_bag_holdout is disabled. (use_bag_holdout=False)
Stack configuration (auto_stack=True): num_stack_levels=1, num_bag_folds=8, num_bag_sets=1
DyStack is enabled (dynamic_stacking=True). AutoGluon will try to determine whether the input data is affected by stacked overfitting and enable or disable stacking as a consequence.
	This is used to identify the optimal `num_stack_levels` value. Copies of AutoGluon will be fit on subsets of the data. Then holdout validation data is used to detect stacked overfitting.
	Running DyStack for up to 900s of the 3600s of remaining time (25%).
	Running DyStack sub-fit in a ray process to avoid memory leakage. Enabling ray logging (enable_ray_logging=True). Specify `ds_args={'enable_ray_logging': False}` if you experience logging issues.

Disabling decision threshold calibration for metric `accuracy` due to having fewer than 10000 rows of validation data for calibration, to avoid overfitting (964 rows).
	`accuracy` is generally not improved through threshold calibration. Force calibration via specifying `calibrate_decision_threshold=True`.
